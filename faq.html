                  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                  dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                  congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                  symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                  become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel
                  unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease
                  without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                  people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                  difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying
                  medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                  diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People
                  with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                  attention.</span

                  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                  disease can spread from person to person through small
                  droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person
                  with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on
                  objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
                  catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then
                  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
                  COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
                  COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
                  important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                  person who is sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the
                  ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                  findings.
