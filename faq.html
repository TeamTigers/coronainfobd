This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </span> <a class="right" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#:~:text=symptoms" >*Original content</a > </div></li><li> <div class="collapsible-header round gsans"> <i class="material-icons">search</i>What are the symptoms of COVID-19? </div><div class="collapsible-body"> <span class="gsans"> The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</span > <a class="right" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#:~:text=symptoms" >*Original content</a > </div></li><li> <div class="collapsible-header round gsans"> <i class="material-icons">search</i>How does COVID-19 spread? </div><div class="collapsible-body"> <span class="gsans"> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. </span> <a class="right" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#:~:text=symptoms" >*Original content</a > </div></li><li> <div class="collapsible-header round gsans"> <i class="material-icons">search</i> Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person? </div><div class="collapsible-body"> <span class="gsans" >Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household workplace, or health care centre. </span> <a class="right" href="http://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/corona-virus/questions-and-answers.html" >*Original content</a > </div></li><li> <div class="collapsible-header round gsans"> <i class="material-icons">search</i> Is there a vaccine for a novel coronavirus? </div><div class="collapsible-body"> <span class="gsans" >When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed.

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. </li><li> <b class="red-text">○</b> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. </li><li> <b class="red-text">○</b> Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. </li><li> <b class="red-text">○</b> Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. </li><li> <b class="red-text">○</b> Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. </li><li> <b class="red-text">○</b> Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. </li><a class="right" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#:~:text=symptoms" >*Original content</a > </ul> </span> </div></li><li> <div class="collapsible-header round gsans"> <i class="material-icons">search</i> Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? </div><div class="collapsible-body"> <span class="gsans" >While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.
