In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. <o:p></o:p> <span class="right lime-text text-darken-1" >source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus" target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a ></span > </p><br/> <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <o:p></o:p> <br/> </p><p> Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. <o:p></o:p> <br/> </p><p> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <o:p></o:p> <br/> </p><p> The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). <o:p></o:p> <br/> </p><p> At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.

However, many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19. <br/> <h5 class="left-align indigo-text text-lighten-1"> Self care </h5> <p> If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. <o:p></o:p> Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family, can help.

These recommendations would ensure both safety and quality of health care and public health security. The DGHS recommendations include placing the infected person in a well-ventilated single room. It suggests that household members should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible, maintain a distance of at least one meter from the ill person. The infected person has also been advised to keep away animals. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> If the infected person lives with other people he or she must use a toilet and bathroom that no one else in the house uses. The infected person must himself put his used laundry in a plastic bag. He then must wash these clothes with detergent of soap himself, the DGHS said. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> The release reads that the infected person must wear mask in case of going out of house and masks must be changed after every use. These masks must also be discarded. Gloves, tissues, masks and other waste generated by ill persons or in the care of ill persons should be placed in a lined container in the ill person’s room before disposal with other household waste, it read further. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> While coughing or spitting the infected person must use a clean tissue, put it into a waste bag and wash hands. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> Eating utensils and dishes should be cleaned with either soap or detergent and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded and persons with symptoms should remain at home until their symptoms are resolved based on either clinical and/or laboratory findings, the release said. <o:p></o:p> </p><p> If symptoms appear he or she must contact the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control And Research (IEDCR) immediately, advised the release. Additionally the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a recent release said the healthcare providers must also follow some directions while rendering healthcare to COVID-19 patients. They must notify the receiving medical facility that a symptomatic contact will be coming to their facility. They must avoid public transportation to the health care facility, if possible; call an ambulance or transport the ill person with a private vehicle and open the windows of the vehicle if possible. Appropriate hand hygiene should be employed by the ill contact and caregivers. Any surfaces that become soiled with respiratory secretions or body fluids during transport should be cleaned and disinfected with regular household containing a diluted bleach solution. </p><span class="right" ><a href="http://m.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/241111" >Source</a ></span > </div></div></div></div><footer class="page-footer blue-grey darken-3"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col l6 s12"> <h5 class="white-text"> CoronaInfoBD </h5> <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> It is a voluntary act aimed at mass awareness.
