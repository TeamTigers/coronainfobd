              Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases
              in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory
              tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild
              illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other
              possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal
              varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other
              species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract
              disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet
              to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human
              coronavirus infections.

            <p>
              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a newly discovered coronavirus. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild
              to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring
              special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
              problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
              respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
              illness. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
              informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how
              it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
              your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not
              touching your face. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
              discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
              so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
              (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
              <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for
              COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials
              evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide
              updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

                The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.
                COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will
                develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring
                special treatment. People who have underlying medical conditions
                and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing
                severe disease and death. <o:p></o:p>
              </p>
              Common symptoms include:
              <ul>
                <li>→ fever</li>
                <li>→ tiredness</li>
                <li>→ dry cough</li>
              </ul>
              Some people may experience:
              <ul>
                <li>→ shortness of breath</li>
                <li>→ aches and pains</li>
                <li>→ sore throat</li>
                <li>
                  → and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny
                  nose.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with
                the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14
                days. <o:p></o:p>
              </p>
              <p>
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should
                self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19
                information line for advice on testing and referral. People with
                fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor
                and seek medical attention.

              As COVID-19 has become a serious issue lately so we need to
              maintain some rules to keep safe ourselves from this virus. To
              prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the
              following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  → Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them

                </li>
                <li>
                  → Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people
                  coughing or sneezing.
                </li>
                <li>→ Avoid touching your face, eyes or mouth.</li>
                <li>
                  → Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue
                  when you cough or sneeze.
                </li>

                  lungs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  → Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel
                  and staying away from large groups of people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  → If you have a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                  medical attention. Call in advance.
                </li>
                <li>

              There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However,
              many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a
              healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
              several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate
              potential therapeutics for COVID-19. <br />

              <br />
              <p>
                If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat
                nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family
                members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and
                disinfect frequently touched surfaces. <o:p></o:p>

                Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a
                healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with
                loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra
                love and attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to
                regular routines and schedules as much as possible.

              <p>
                It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis.
                Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family, can
                help. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or
                counsellor. <o:p></o:p>
