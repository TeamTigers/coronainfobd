              Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases
              in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory
              tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild
              illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other
              possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal
              varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other
              species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract
              disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet
              to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human
              coronavirus infections.

            <br />
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a newly discovered coronavirus. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild
              to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring
              special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
              problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
              respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
              illness. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
              informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how
              it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
              your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not
              touching your face. <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
              discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
              so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
              (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
              <o:p></o:p> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for
              COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials
              evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide
              updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

                The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.
                COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will
                develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring
                special treatment. People who have underlying medical conditions
                and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing
                severe disease and death. <o:p></o:p>
              </p>
              Common symptoms include:
              <ul>
                <li>→ fever</li>
                <li>→ tiredness</li>
                <li>→ dry cough</li>
              </ul>
              Some people may experience:
              <ul>
                <li>→ shortness of breath</li>
                <li>→ aches and pains</li>
                <li>→ sore throat</li>
                <li>
                  → and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny
                  nose.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with
                the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14
                days. <o:p></o:p>
              </p>
              <p>
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should
                self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19
                information line for advice on testing and referral. People with
                fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor
                and seek medical attention.

              As COVID-19 has become a serious issue lately so we need to
              maintain some rules to keep safe ourselves from this virus. To
              prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the
              following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  → Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them

                <li>
                  → Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people
                  coughing or sneezing.
                </li>
                <li>→ Avoid touching your face, eyes or mouth.</li>
                <li>
                  → Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue
                  when you cough or sneeze.
                </li>
                <li>→ Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>

                  → Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the
                  lungs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  → Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel
                  and staying away from large groups of people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  → If you have a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                  medical attention. Call in advance.
                </li>
                <li>

              There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However,
              many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a
              healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
              several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate
              potential therapeutics for COVID-19. <br />

              </h5>
              <p>
                If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat
                nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family
                members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and
                disinfect frequently touched surfaces. <o:p></o:p>

                Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a
                healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with
                loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra
                love and attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to
                regular routines and schedules as much as possible.

                It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis.
                Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family, can
                help. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or
                counsellor. <o:p></o:p>

              Home quarantine
            </h5>
            <p>
              In view of the currently limited knowledge of the disease caused
              by COVID-19 infection and its transmission patterns, the
              Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) yesterday came up
              with a set of recommendations for coronavirus patients in a press
              release. These recommendations would ensure both safety and
              quality of health care and public health security. The DGHS
              recommendations include placing the infected person in a
              well-ventilated single room. It suggests that household members
              should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible,
              maintain a distance of at least one meter from the ill person. The
              infected person has also been advised to keep away animals.
              <o:p></o:p>
            </p>
            <p>
              If the infected person lives with other people he or she must use
              a toilet and bathroom that no one else in the house uses. The
              infected person must himself put his used laundry in a plastic
              bag. He then must wash these clothes with detergent of soap
              himself, the DGHS said. <o:p></o:p>
            </p>
            <p>
              The release reads that the infected person must wear mask in case
              of going out of house and masks must be changed after every use.
              These masks must also be discarded. Gloves, tissues, masks and
              other waste generated by ill persons or in the care of ill persons
              should be placed in a lined container in the ill person’s room
              before disposal with other household waste, it read further.
              <o:p></o:p>
            </p>
            <p>
              While coughing or spitting the infected person must use a clean
              tissue, put it into a waste bag and wash hands. <o:p></o:p>
            </p>
            <p>
              Eating utensils and dishes should be cleaned with either soap or
              detergent and water after use and may be re-used instead of being
              discarded and persons with symptoms should remain at home until
              their symptoms are resolved based on either clinical and/or
              laboratory findings, the release said. <o:p></o:p>
            </p>
            <p>
              If symptoms appear he or she must contact the Institute of
              Epidemiology Disease Control And Research (IEDCR) immediately,
              advised the release. Additionally the World Health Organisation
              (WHO) in a recent release said the healthcare providers must also
              follow some directions while rendering healthcare to COVID-19
              patients. They must notify the receiving medical facility that a
              symptomatic contact will be coming to their facility. They must
              avoid public transportation to the health care facility, if
              possible; call an ambulance or transport the ill person with a
              private vehicle and open the windows of the vehicle if possible.
              Appropriate hand hygiene should be employed by the ill contact and
              caregivers. Any surfaces that become soiled with respiratory
              secretions or body fluids during transport should be cleaned and
              disinfected with regular household containing a diluted bleach
              solution.
